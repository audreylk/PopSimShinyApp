# PopSimShinyApp

This will be a web app for population ecology simulations.  Users can manipulate the parameters controlling population growth and interactions and see the output in graphical format.  The current plan is to include tabs for Lotka-Volterra competition and single population growth, with the option to build in additional simulations at any time (next up would be Lotka-Volterra predator-prey). It is meant to be a tool for use in undergraduate Ecology courses. Eventually, it will be hosted by Carolina Cloud Apps with the Shiny Server so that it will be accessible to anyone via a website without the need for downloading the code and running it through R.
