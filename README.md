# PopSimShinyApp

This will be a web app for population ecology simulations.  Users can manipulate the parameters controlling population growth and interactions and see the output in graphical format.  The current plan is to include tabs for Lotka-Volterra competition, Lotka-Volterra predator-prey interactions, and single population growth, with the option to build in additional simulations at any time. It is meant to be a tool for use in undergraduate Ecology courses.
